#Backdoor Detection and Clease
## Instruction for running the Entropy filter notebook:
First put all the data.h files under the path below:
"/content/drive/MyDrive/MLsecurity_project/data/"
And also put all the model.h files under the path below:
"/content/drive/MyDrive/MLsecurity_project/models/"
Then, you could just run the whole notebook. 
If you want to use your own test data, just replace the input data on this three parts:
Model repair->For sunglasses_bd_net.h5->Input data
Model repair->For multi_trigger_multi_target_bd_net.h5->Input data
Model repair->anonymous_bd_net.h5->Input data
